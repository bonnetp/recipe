## Ingredients


### Brownie :
- 185g unsalted butter
- 185g best dark chocolate
- 85g plain flour
- 40g cocoa powder
- 50g white chocolate
- 50g milk chocolate
- 3 large eggs
- 275g golden caster sugar

### Pecan Pie Topping:
  - ⅓ cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled
  - 1 cup packed brown sugar
  - ¾ cup light corn syrup
  - 3 eggs
  - 1 teaspoons vanilla
  - pinch of salt
  - 2 cups pecans, coarsely chopped

## Preparation

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
  2. Mix brownies according to package instructions.
  3. Pour brownie batter into a greased 13x9 inch pan and place in oven to bake for 20 minutes.
  4. While the brownies bake, mix together the butter, brown sugar, corn syrup, eggs, vanilla and salt. Stir in the pecans and mix thoroughly.
  5. After 20 minutes remove the brownies from the oven and pour the pecan pie filling over them.
  6. Place them back in the oven and bake for 30-40 minutes (the filling in the middle will only jiggle slightly when you move the pan).
  7. Let cool to room temperature before cutting.
