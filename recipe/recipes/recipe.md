# Ingredients

Brownies:
1 box (18.3 oz) Family size chewy fudge brownie mix (I used Duncan Hines) + ingredients listed on the package (for fudge like brownies)
Pecan Pie Topping:
⅓ cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled
1 cup packed brown sugar
¾ cup light corn syrup
3 eggs
1 teaspoons vanilla
pinch of salt
2 cups pecans, coarsely chopped
Preparation

1Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2Mix brownies according to package instructions.
3Pour brownie batter into a greased 13x9 inch pan and place in oven to bake for 20 minutes.
4While the brownies bake, mix together the butter, brown sugar, corn syrup, eggs, vanilla and salt. Stir in the pecans and mix thoroughly.
5After 20 minutes remove the brownies from the oven and pour the pecan pie filling over them.
6Place them back in the oven and bake for 30-40 minutes (the filling in the middle will only jiggle slightly when you move the pan).
7Let cool to room temperature before cutting.
